# **Taxi Pricing Analysis with Mobility Data**

## **Introduction**

**Unveiling the Dynamics Behind Surge Pricing in Urban Mobility**

In the evolving landscape of smart transportation, understanding the factors that influence taxi pricing—especially surge pricing—is vital for building efficient mobility systems and customer-centric pricing strategies. This project focuses on predicting the **surge pricing type** of taxi rides based on a variety of user, ride, and lifestyle-related features.

Using a comprehensive dataset from **Sigma Cabs**, this analysis dives into variables such as **type of cab, customer history, lifestyle indicators, trip distance**, and **masked continuous variables**, to uncover meaningful patterns that drive dynamic fare adjustments. The presence of hidden features and anonymized metrics like `Var1`, `Var2`, and `Var3` adds an extra layer of complexity and realism to the dataset, simulating real-world business constraints.

Our pipeline includes detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, advanced **feature engineering** (including handling of missing values and encoding), and the training of **classification models** such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** to determine the most accurate approach for predicting surge pricing types.

Through this study, we aim to derive data-driven insights that can empower cab aggregators to better understand their pricing logic, optimize operations, and enhance the rider experience in a demand-sensitive marketplace.
